<a id='L1' name='L1'></a>                        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<a id='L2' name='L2'></a>                          Version 3, 29 June 2007
<a id='L3' name='L3'></a> 
<a id='L4' name='L4'></a>Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
<a id='L5' name='L5'></a> 
<a id='L6' name='L6'></a>    Everyone is  permitted  to copy  and  distribute  verbatim  copies  of  this
<a id='L7' name='L7'></a>license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<a id='L8' name='L8'></a> 
<a id='L9' name='L9'></a>                                Preamble
<a id='L10' name='L10'></a> 
<a id='L11' name='L11'></a>    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software  and
<a id='L12' name='L12'></a>other kinds of works.
<a id='L13' name='L13'></a> 
<a id='L14' name='L14'></a>    The licenses for most software and other practical  works  are  designed  to
<a id='L15' name='L15'></a>take away your freedom to share and change  the  works.  By  contrast,  the  GNU
<a id='L16' name='L16'></a>General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
<a id='L17' name='L17'></a>all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free  software  for  all  its
<a id='L18' name='L18'></a>users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License  for
<a id='L19' name='L19'></a>most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its
<a id='L20' name='L20'></a>authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
<a id='L21' name='L21'></a> 
<a id='L22' name='L22'></a>    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
<a id='L23' name='L23'></a>General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the  freedom  to
<a id='L24' name='L24'></a>distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish),  that  you
<a id='L25' name='L25'></a>receive source code or can get it if you  want  it,  that  you  can  change  the
<a id='L26' name='L26'></a>software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can  do
<a id='L27' name='L27'></a>these things.
<a id='L28' name='L28'></a> 
<a id='L29' name='L29'></a>    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others  from  denying  you  these
<a id='L30' name='L30'></a>rights or asking you to  surrender  the  rights.  Therefore,  you  have  certain
<a id='L31' name='L31'></a>responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify  it:
<a id='L32' name='L32'></a>responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<a id='L33' name='L33'></a> 
<a id='L34' name='L34'></a>    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  gratis  or
<a id='L35' name='L35'></a>for a fee, you must pass on  to  the  recipients  the  same  freedoms  that  you
<a id='L36' name='L36'></a>received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<a id='L37' name='L37'></a>And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<a id='L38' name='L38'></a> 
<a id='L39' name='L39'></a>    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your  rights  with  two  steps:  (1)
<a id='L40' name='L40'></a>assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer  you  this  License  giving  you
<a id='L41' name='L41'></a>legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<a id='L42' name='L42'></a> 
<a id='L43' name='L43'></a>    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly  explains  that
<a id='L44' name='L44'></a>there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake,
<a id='L45' name='L45'></a>the GPL requires that modified versions be marked  as  changed,  so  that  their
<a id='L46' name='L46'></a>problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
<a id='L47' name='L47'></a> 
<a id='L48' name='L48'></a>    Some devices are designed to deny  users  access  to install or run modified
<a id='L49' name='L49'></a>versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This
<a id='L50' name='L50'></a>is fundamentally incompatible with  the  aim  of  protecting  users' freedom  to
<a id='L51' name='L51'></a>change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area  of
<a id='L52' name='L52'></a>products  for  individuals  to  use,  which  is  precisely  where  it  is   most
<a id='L53' name='L53'></a>unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the  GPL  to  prohibit
<a id='L54' name='L54'></a>the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially  in  other
<a id='L55' name='L55'></a>domains, we stand ready to extend this provision  to  those  domains  in  future
<a id='L56' name='L56'></a>versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<a id='L57' name='L57'></a> 
<a id='L58' name='L58'></a>    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  States
<a id='L59' name='L59'></a>should not allow  patents  to  restrict  development  and  use  of  software  on
<a id='L60' name='L60'></a>general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to  avoid  the  special
<a id='L61' name='L61'></a>danger that patents  applied  to  a  free  program  could  make  it  effectively
<a id='L62' name='L62'></a>proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents  cannot  be  used  to
<a id='L63' name='L63'></a>render the program non-free.
<a id='L64' name='L64'></a> 
<a id='L65' name='L65'></a>    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification
<a id='L66' name='L66'></a>follow.
<a id='L67' name='L67'></a> 
<a id='L68' name='L68'></a>                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<a id='L69' name='L69'></a> 
<a id='L70' name='L70'></a>0. Definitions.
<a id='L71' name='L71'></a>---------------
<a id='L72' name='L72'></a> 
<a id='L73' name='L73'></a>    “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<a id='L74' name='L74'></a> 
<a id='L75' name='L75'></a>    “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that  apply  to  other  kinds  of
<a id='L76' name='L76'></a>works, such as semiconductor masks.
<a id='L77' name='L77'></a> 
<a id='L78' name='L78'></a>    “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this  License.
<a id='L79' name='L79'></a>Each licensee is  addressed  as  “you”.  “Licensees”  and  “recipients”  may  be
<a id='L80' name='L80'></a>individuals or organizations.
<a id='L81' name='L81'></a> 
<a id='L82' name='L82'></a>    To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in  a
<a id='L83' name='L83'></a>fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact  copy.
<a id='L84' name='L84'></a>The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a  work
<a id='L85' name='L85'></a>“based on” the earlier work.
<a id='L86' name='L86'></a> 
<a id='L87' name='L87'></a>    A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on  the
<a id='L88' name='L88'></a>Program.
<a id='L89' name='L89'></a> 
<a id='L90' name='L90'></a>    To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
<a id='L91' name='L91'></a>would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under  applicable
<a id='L92' name='L92'></a>copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying  a  private  copy.
<a id='L93' name='L93'></a>Propagation includes  copying,  distribution  (with  or  without  modification),
<a id='L94' name='L94'></a>making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<a id='L95' name='L95'></a> 
<a id='L96' name='L96'></a>    To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other  parties
<a id='L97' name='L97'></a>to make or receive copies. Mere interaction  with  a  user  through  a  computer
<a id='L98' name='L98'></a>network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<a id='L99' name='L99'></a> 
<a id='L100' name='L100'></a>    An interactive user interface displays  “Appropriate Legal Notices”  to  the
<a id='L101' name='L101'></a>extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible  feature  that  (1)
<a id='L102' name='L102'></a>displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that  there  is
<a id='L103' name='L103'></a>no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
<a id='L104' name='L104'></a>that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of
<a id='L105' name='L105'></a>this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such
<a id='L106' name='L106'></a>as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<a id='L107' name='L107'></a> 
<a id='L108' name='L108'></a> 
<a id='L109' name='L109'></a>1. Source Code.
<a id='L110' name='L110'></a>---------------
<a id='L111' name='L111'></a> 
<a id='L112' name='L112'></a>    The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
<a id='L113' name='L113'></a>modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.
<a id='L114' name='L114'></a> 
<a id='L115' name='L115'></a>    A “Standard Interface”  means  an  interface  that  either  is  an  official
<a id='L116' name='L116'></a>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case  of  interfaces
<a id='L117' name='L117'></a>specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely  used  among
<a id='L118' name='L118'></a>developers working in that language.
<a id='L119' name='L119'></a> 
<a id='L120' name='L120'></a>    The “System Libraries” of an executable work include  anything,  other  than
<a id='L121' name='L121'></a>the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the  normal  form  of  packaging  a
<a id='L122' name='L122'></a>Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and  (b)  serves
<a id='L123' name='L123'></a>only to enable use of the work with that Major  Component,  or  to  implement  a
<a id='L124' name='L124'></a>Standard Interface for which an implementation is available  to  the  public  in
<a id='L125' name='L125'></a>source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major  essential
<a id='L126' name='L126'></a>component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the  specific  operating  system
<a id='L127' name='L127'></a>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used  to  produce  the
<a id='L128' name='L128'></a>work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<a id='L129' name='L129'></a> 
<a id='L130' name='L130'></a>    The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object  code  form  means  all  the
<a id='L131' name='L131'></a>source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable  work)  run  the
<a id='L132' name='L132'></a>object code  and  to  modify  the  work,  including  scripts  to  control  those
<a id='L133' name='L133'></a>activities. However, it  does  not  include  the  work's  System  Libraries,  or
<a id='L134' name='L134'></a>general-purpose tools or  generally  available  free  programs  which  are  used
<a id='L135' name='L135'></a>unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part  of  the  work.
<a id='L136' name='L136'></a>For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
<a id='L137' name='L137'></a>with source files for the work, and the source code  for  shared  libraries  and
<a id='L138' name='L138'></a>dynamically linked  subprograms  that  the  work  is  specifically  designed  to
<a id='L139' name='L139'></a>require, such as by intimate data communication or control  flow  between  those
<a id='L140' name='L140'></a>subprograms and other parts of the work.
<a id='L141' name='L141'></a> 
<a id='L142' name='L142'></a>    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
<a id='L143' name='L143'></a>automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
<a id='L144' name='L144'></a> 
<a id='L145' name='L145'></a>    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
<a id='L146' name='L146'></a> 
<a id='L147' name='L147'></a>2. Basic Permissions.
<a id='L148' name='L148'></a>---------------------
<a id='L149' name='L149'></a> 
<a id='L150' name='L150'></a>    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of  copyright
<a id='L151' name='L151'></a>on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This
<a id='L152' name='L152'></a>License explicitly affirms your  unlimited  permission  to  run  the  unmodified
<a id='L153' name='L153'></a>Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License  only
<a id='L154' name='L154'></a>if the output, given its content,  constitutes  a  covered  work.  This  License
<a id='L155' name='L155'></a>acknowledges your rights of  fair  use  or  other  equivalent,  as  provided  by
<a id='L156' name='L156'></a>copyright law.
<a id='L157' name='L157'></a> 
<a id='L158' name='L158'></a>    You may make, run and propagate  covered  works  that  you  do  not  convey,
<a id='L159' name='L159'></a>without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You  may
<a id='L160' name='L160'></a>convey covered works to  others  for  the  sole  purpose  of  having  them  make
<a id='L161' name='L161'></a>modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with  facilities  for  running
<a id='L162' name='L162'></a>those works, provided that  you  comply  with  the  terms  of  this  License  in
<a id='L163' name='L163'></a>conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making
<a id='L164' name='L164'></a>or running the covered works for you must do  so  exclusively  on  your  behalf,
<a id='L165' name='L165'></a>under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them  from  making  any
<a id='L166' name='L166'></a>copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<a id='L167' name='L167'></a> 
<a id='L168' name='L168'></a>    Conveying under any  other  circumstances  is  permitted  solely  under  the
<a id='L169' name='L169'></a>conditions stated below. Sublicensing  is  not  allowed;  section  10  makes  it
<a id='L170' name='L170'></a>unnecessary.
<a id='L171' name='L171'></a> 
<a id='L172' name='L172'></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<a id='L173' name='L173'></a>--------------------------------------------------------------
<a id='L174' name='L174'></a> 
<a id='L175' name='L175'></a>    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective  technological  measure
<a id='L176' name='L176'></a>under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article  11  of  the  WIPO
<a id='L177' name='L177'></a>copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or  similar  laws  prohibiting  or
<a id='L178' name='L178'></a>restricting circumvention of such measures.
<a id='L179' name='L179'></a> 
<a id='L180' name='L180'></a>    When you convey a  covered  work,  you  waive  any  legal  power  to  forbid
<a id='L181' name='L181'></a>circumvention of technological measures to  the  extent  such  circumvention  is
<a id='L182' name='L182'></a>effected by exercising rights under this License with  respect  to  the  covered
<a id='L183' name='L183'></a>work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification  of  the
<a id='L184' name='L184'></a>work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or  third  parties'
<a id='L185' name='L185'></a>legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
<a id='L186' name='L186'></a> 
<a id='L187' name='L187'></a> 
<a id='L188' name='L188'></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<a id='L189' name='L189'></a>-----------------------------
<a id='L190' name='L190'></a> 
<a id='L191' name='L191'></a>    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as  you  receive
<a id='L192' name='L192'></a>it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish  on
<a id='L193' name='L193'></a>each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating  that
<a id='L194' name='L194'></a>this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section  7  apply
<a id='L195' name='L195'></a>to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any  warranty;  and  give
<a id='L196' name='L196'></a>all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<a id='L197' name='L197'></a> 
<a id='L198' name='L198'></a>    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and  you
<a id='L199' name='L199'></a>may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
<a id='L200' name='L200'></a> 
<a id='L201' name='L201'></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<a id='L202' name='L202'></a>--------------------------------------
<a id='L203' name='L203'></a> 
<a id='L204' name='L204'></a>    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to  produce
<a id='L205' name='L205'></a>it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms  of  section  4,
<a id='L206' name='L206'></a>provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<a id='L207' name='L207'></a> 
<a id='L208' name='L208'></a>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified  it,  and
<a id='L209' name='L209'></a>       giving a relevant date.
<a id='L210' name='L210'></a>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is  released  under
<a id='L211' name='L211'></a>       this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This  requirement
<a id='L212' name='L212'></a>       modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.
<a id='L213' name='L213'></a>    c) You must license the entire work, as  a  whole,  under  this  License  to
<a id='L214' name='L214'></a>       anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License  will  therefore
<a id='L215' name='L215'></a>       apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole
<a id='L216' name='L216'></a>       of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
<a id='L217' name='L217'></a>       License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but  it
<a id='L218' name='L218'></a>       does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
<a id='L219' name='L219'></a>    d) If  the  work  has  interactive  user  interfaces,  each   must   display
<a id='L220' name='L220'></a>       Appropriate Legal  Notices;  however,  if  the  Program  has  interactive
<a id='L221' name='L221'></a>       interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work  need
<a id='L222' name='L222'></a>       not make them do so.
<a id='L223' name='L223'></a> 
<a id='L224' name='L224'></a>    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and  independent  works,
<a id='L225' name='L225'></a>which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are  not
<a id='L226' name='L226'></a>combined  with it such as to  form a larger  program,  in or on a  volume  of  a
<a id='L227' name='L227'></a>storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation  and
<a id='L228' name='L228'></a>its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of  the
<a id='L229' name='L229'></a>compilation's users beyond what  the  individual  works  permit.  Inclusion of a
<a id='L230' name='L230'></a>covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to  apply to the  other
<a id='L231' name='L231'></a>parts of the aggregate.

<a id='L233' name='L233'></a>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<a id='L234' name='L234'></a>------------------------------
<a id='L235' name='L235'></a> 
<a id='L236' name='L236'></a>    You may  convey a covered  work in  object  code  form  under  the  terms of
<a id='L237' name='L237'></a>sections  4  and  5,  provided  that  you  also  convey   the   machine-readable
<a id='L238' name='L238'></a>Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
<a id='L239' name='L239'></a> 
<a id='L240' name='L240'></a>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  (including
<a id='L241' name='L241'></a>       a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding  Source
<a id='L242' name='L242'></a>       fixed  on  a  durable  physical  medium  customarily  used  for  software
<a id='L243' name='L243'></a>       interchange.
<a id='L244' name='L244'></a>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  (including
<a id='L245' name='L245'></a>       a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a  written  offer,  valid
<a id='L246' name='L246'></a>       for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer  spare  parts
<a id='L247' name='L247'></a>       or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who  possesses
<a id='L248' name='L248'></a>       the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
<a id='L249' name='L249'></a>       software in the product that is covered by  this  License,  on a  durable
<a id='L250' name='L250'></a>       physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
<a id='L251' name='L251'></a>       more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of
<a id='L252' name='L252'></a>       source, or (2) access to  copy the  Corresponding Source  from a  network
<a id='L253' name='L253'></a>       server at no charge.
<a id='L254' name='L254'></a>    c) Convey individual copies of the  object code  with a copy of the  written
<a id='L255' name='L255'></a>       offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This  alternative  is  allowed
<a id='L256' name='L256'></a>       only occasionally and noncommercially,  and  only  if  you  received  the
<a id='L257' name='L257'></a>       object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
<a id='L258' name='L258'></a>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis
<a id='L259' name='L259'></a>       or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source
<a id='L260' name='L260'></a>       in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not
<a id='L261' name='L261'></a>       require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object
<a id='L262' name='L262'></a>       code. If the place to copy the object  code  is  a  network  server,  the
<a id='L263' name='L263'></a>       Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you  or  a
<a id='L264' name='L264'></a>       third party) that supports equivalent copying  facilities,  provided  you
<a id='L265' name='L265'></a>       maintain clear directions next to the object code saying  where  to  find
<a id='L266' name='L266'></a>       the  Corresponding   Source.   Regardless  of  what   server   hosts  the
<a id='L267' name='L267'></a>       Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available
<a id='L268' name='L268'></a>       for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
<a id='L269' name='L269'></a>    e) Convey the object code  using  peer-to-peer  transmission,  provided  you
<a id='L270' name='L270'></a>       inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of  the
<a id='L271' name='L271'></a>       work are  being  offered  to  the  general  public  at  no  charge  under
<a id='L272' name='L272'></a>       subsection 6d.
<a id='L273' name='L273'></a> 
<a id='L274' name='L274'></a>    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is  excluded  from
<a id='L275' name='L275'></a>the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in  conveying
<a id='L276' name='L276'></a>the object code work.
<a id='L277' name='L277'></a> 
<a id='L278' name='L278'></a>    A “User Product”  is  either  (1)  a  “consumer product”,  which  means  any
<a id='L279' name='L279'></a>tangible personal property which is  normally  used  for  personal,  family,  or
<a id='L280' name='L280'></a>household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for  incorporation  into  a
<a id='L281' name='L281'></a>dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases
<a id='L282' name='L282'></a>shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received  by  a
<a id='L283' name='L283'></a>particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class
<a id='L284' name='L284'></a>of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or  of  the  way  in
<a id='L285' name='L285'></a>which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to  use,  the
<a id='L286' name='L286'></a>product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the  product  has
<a id='L287' name='L287'></a>substantial commercial,  industrial  or  non-consumer  uses,  unless  such  uses
<a id='L288' name='L288'></a>represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
<a id='L289' name='L289'></a> 
<a id='L290' name='L290'></a>    “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
<a id='L291' name='L291'></a>authorization keys,  or  other  information  required  to  install  and  execute
<a id='L292' name='L292'></a>modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version
<a id='L293' name='L293'></a>of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice  to  ensure  that  the
<a id='L294' name='L294'></a>continued functioning of the modified object code is in  no  case  prevented  or
<a id='L295' name='L295'></a>interfered with solely because modification has been made.
<a id='L296' name='L296'></a> 
<a id='L297' name='L297'></a>    If you convey an object code  work  under  this  section  in,  or  with,  or
<a id='L298' name='L298'></a>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part  of  a
<a id='L299' name='L299'></a>transaction in which the right of possession and use  of  the  User  Product  is
<a id='L300' name='L300'></a>transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed  term  (regardless  of
<a id='L301' name='L301'></a>how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source  conveyed  under
<a id='L302' name='L302'></a>this section must be accompanied  by  the  Installation  Information.  But  this
<a id='L303' name='L303'></a>requirement does not apply if neither  you  nor  any  third  party  retains  the
<a id='L304' name='L304'></a>ability to install modified object code on the User Product  (for  example,  the
<a id='L305' name='L305'></a>work has been installed in ROM).
<a id='L306' name='L306'></a> 
<a id='L307' name='L307'></a>    The requirement to provide  Installation  Information  does  not  include  a
<a id='L308' name='L308'></a>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates  for  a
<a id='L309' name='L309'></a>work that has been modified or installed by  the  recipient,  or  for  the  User
<a id='L310' name='L310'></a>Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network  may  be
<a id='L311' name='L311'></a>denied when  the  modification  itself  materially  and  adversely  affects  the
<a id='L312' name='L312'></a>operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols  for  communication
<a id='L313' name='L313'></a>across the network.
<a id='L314' name='L314'></a> 
<a id='L315' name='L315'></a>    Corresponding Source conveyed, and  Installation  Information  provided,  in
<a id='L316' name='L316'></a>accord with this section must be in a format that is  publicly  documented  (and
<a id='L317' name='L317'></a>with an implementation available to the public in source code  form),  and  must
<a id='L318' name='L318'></a>require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
<a id='L319' name='L319'></a> 
<a id='L320' name='L320'></a>7. Additional Terms.
<a id='L321' name='L321'></a>--------------------
<a id='L322' name='L322'></a> 
<a id='L323' name='L323'></a>    “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License
<a id='L324' name='L324'></a>by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional  permissions
<a id='L325' name='L325'></a>that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though  they  were
<a id='L326' name='L326'></a>included in this License, to the extent that they  are  valid  under  applicable
<a id='L327' name='L327'></a>law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part  may
<a id='L328' name='L328'></a>be used separately under those  permissions,  but  the  entire  Program  remains
<a id='L329' name='L329'></a>governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
<a id='L330' name='L330'></a> 
<a id='L331' name='L331'></a>    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove  any
<a id='L332' name='L332'></a>additional permissions from that copy, or  from  any  part  of  it.  (Additional
<a id='L333' name='L333'></a>permissions may be written to require their own removal in  certain  cases  when
<a id='L334' name='L334'></a>you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by
<a id='L335' name='L335'></a>you to a covered work, for which you have  or  can  give  appropriate  copyright
<a id='L336' name='L336'></a>permission.
<a id='L337' name='L337'></a> 
<a id='L338' name='L338'></a>    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to
<a id='L339' name='L339'></a>a covered work, you  may  (if  authorized  by  the  copyright  holders  of  that
<a id='L340' name='L340'></a>material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
<a id='L341' name='L341'></a> 
<a id='L342' name='L342'></a>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms  of
<a id='L343' name='L343'></a>       sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<a id='L344' name='L344'></a>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal  notices  or  author
<a id='L345' name='L345'></a>       attributions in  that  material  or  in  the  Appropriate  Legal  Notices
<a id='L346' name='L346'></a>       displayed by works containing it; or
<a id='L347' name='L347'></a>    c) Prohibiting  misrepresentation  of  the  origin  of  that   material,  or
<a id='L348' name='L348'></a>       requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable
<a id='L349' name='L349'></a>       ways as different from the original version; or
<a id='L350' name='L350'></a>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or  authors
<a id='L351' name='L351'></a>       of the material; or
<a id='L352' name='L352'></a>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark  law  for  use  of  some  trade
<a id='L353' name='L353'></a>       names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<a id='L354' name='L354'></a>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of  that  material  by
<a id='L355' name='L355'></a>       anyone who conveys  the  material  (or  modified  versions  of  it)  with
<a id='L356' name='L356'></a>       contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any  liability
<a id='L357' name='L357'></a>       that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and
<a id='L358' name='L358'></a>       authors.
<a id='L359' name='L359'></a> 
<a id='L360' name='L360'></a>    All  other  non-permissive  additional   terms   are   considered   “further
<a id='L361' name='L361'></a>restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as  you  received
<a id='L362' name='L362'></a>it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it  is  governed  by  this
<a id='L363' name='L363'></a>License along with a term that is a further restriction,  you  may  remove  that
<a id='L364' name='L364'></a>term.  If  a  license  document  contains  a  further  restriction  but  permits
<a id='L365' name='L365'></a>relicensing or conveying under this License, you  may  add  to  a  covered  work
<a id='L366' name='L366'></a>material governed by the terms of  that  license  document,  provided  that  the
<a id='L367' name='L367'></a>further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
<a id='L368' name='L368'></a> 
<a id='L369' name='L369'></a>    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with  this  section,  you  must
<a id='L370' name='L370'></a>place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the  additional  terms  that
<a id='L371' name='L371'></a>apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
<a id='L372' name='L372'></a> 
<a id='L373' name='L373'></a>    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of
<a id='L374' name='L374'></a>a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;  the  above  requirements
<a id='L375' name='L375'></a>apply either way.
<a id='L376' name='L376'></a> 
<a id='L377' name='L377'></a>8. Termination.
<a id='L378' name='L378'></a>---------------
<a id='L379' name='L379'></a> 
<a id='L380' name='L380'></a>    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly  provided
<a id='L381' name='L381'></a>under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and
<a id='L382' name='L382'></a>will automatically terminate your  rights  under  this  License  (including  any
<a id='L383' name='L383'></a>patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
<a id='L384' name='L384'></a> 
<a id='L385' name='L385'></a>    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license  from
<a id='L386' name='L386'></a>a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and  until
<a id='L387' name='L387'></a>the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates  your  license,  and  (b)
<a id='L388' name='L388'></a>permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you  of  the  violation  by
<a id='L389' name='L389'></a>some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
<a id='L390' name='L390'></a> 
<a id='L391' name='L391'></a>    Moreover, your license from a  particular  copyright  holder  is  reinstated
<a id='L392' name='L392'></a>permanently if the copyright holder  notifies  you  of  the  violation  by  some
<a id='L393' name='L393'></a>reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice  of  violation
<a id='L394' name='L394'></a>of this License (for any work) from that copyright  holder,  and  you  cure  the
<a id='L395' name='L395'></a>violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
<a id='L396' name='L396'></a> 
<a id='L397' name='L397'></a>    Termination of your  rights  under  this  section  does  not  terminate  the
<a id='L398' name='L398'></a>licenses of parties who have received copies  or  rights  from  you  under  this
<a id='L399' name='L399'></a>License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you
<a id='L400' name='L400'></a>do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
<a id='L401' name='L401'></a> 
<a id='L402' name='L402'></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<a id='L403' name='L403'></a>---------------------------------------------
<a id='L404' name='L404'></a> 
<a id='L405' name='L405'></a>    You are not required to accept this License in order to  receive  or  run  a
<a id='L406' name='L406'></a>copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as
<a id='L407' name='L407'></a>a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does
<a id='L408' name='L408'></a>not require acceptance. However, nothing other  than  this  License  grants  you
<a id='L409' name='L409'></a>permission to propagate or modify  any  covered  work.  These  actions  infringe
<a id='L410' name='L410'></a>copyright if you  do  not  accept  this  License.  Therefore,  by  modifying  or
<a id='L411' name='L411'></a>propagating a covered work, you indicate your  acceptance  of  this  License  to
<a id='L412' name='L412'></a>do so.
<a id='L413' name='L413'></a> 
<a id='L414' name='L414'></a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<a id='L415' name='L415'></a>-------------------------------------------------
<a id='L416' name='L416'></a> 
<a id='L417' name='L417'></a>    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives  a
<a id='L418' name='L418'></a>license from the original licensors, to run, modify  and  propagate  that  work,
<a id='L419' name='L419'></a>subject to this License. You are not responsible  for  enforcing  compliance  by
<a id='L420' name='L420'></a>third parties with this License.
<a id='L421' name='L421'></a> 
<a id='L422' name='L422'></a>    An  “entity  transaction”  is  a  transaction  transferring  control  of  an
<a id='L423' name='L423'></a>organization,  or  substantially  all   assets   of  one,  or   subdividing   an
<a id='L424' name='L424'></a>organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results
<a id='L425' name='L425'></a>from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives  a  copy
<a id='L426' name='L426'></a>of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's  predecessor
<a id='L427' name='L427'></a>in interest had or could give under the  previous  paragraph,  plus a  right  to
<a id='L428' name='L428'></a>possession of the Corresponding Source of  the  work  from  the  predecessor  in
<a id='L429' name='L429'></a>interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
<a id='L430' name='L430'></a> 
<a id='L431' name='L431'></a>    You may not impose any further restrictions on the  exercise of  the  rights
<a id='L432' name='L432'></a>granted or affirmed under this  License.  For  example,  you  may  not  impose a
<a id='L433' name='L433'></a>license fee, royalty, or other charge for  exercise of rights granted under this
<a id='L434' name='L434'></a>License,  and  you  may  not  initiate  litigation  (including a  cross-claim or
<a id='L435' name='L435'></a>counterclaim in a  lawsuit)  alleging  that  any  patent  claim is infringed  by
<a id='L436' name='L436'></a>making, using,  selling,  offering for  sale, or  importing the  Program or  any
<a id='L437' name='L437'></a>portion of it.
<a id='L438' name='L438'></a> 
<a id='L439' name='L439'></a>11. Patents.
<a id='L440' name='L440'></a>------------
<a id='L441' name='L441'></a> 
<a id='L442' name='L442'></a>    A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this  License
<a id='L443' name='L443'></a>of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work  thus  licensed
<a id='L444' name='L444'></a>is called the contributor's “contributor version”.
<a id='L445' name='L445'></a> 
<a id='L446' name='L446'></a>    A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all  patent  claims  owned  or
<a id='L447' name='L447'></a>controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or  hereafter  acquired,
<a id='L448' name='L448'></a>that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this  License,  of  making,
<a id='L449' name='L449'></a>using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that  would
<a id='L450' name='L450'></a>be infringed only as a consequence of further  modification of  the  contributor
<a id='L451' name='L451'></a>version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to  grant
<a id='L452' name='L452'></a>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
<a id='L453' name='L453'></a> 
<a id='L454' name='L454'></a>    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free  patent
<a id='L455' name='L455'></a>license under the contributor's essential patent claims,  to  make,  use,  sell,
<a id='L456' name='L456'></a>offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the  contents  of
<a id='L457' name='L457'></a>its contributor version.
<a id='L458' name='L458'></a> 
<a id='L459' name='L459'></a>    In the  following  three  paragraphs,  a  “patent license”  is  any  express
<a id='L460' name='L460'></a>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to  enforce a patent  (such as
<a id='L461' name='L461'></a>an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not  to  sue  for  patent
<a id='L462' name='L462'></a>infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an
<a id='L463' name='L463'></a>agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
<a id='L464' name='L464'></a> 
<a id='L465' name='L465'></a>    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
<a id='L466' name='L466'></a>Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to  copy,  free  of
<a id='L467' name='L467'></a>charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network
<a id='L468' name='L468'></a>server or other readily accessible means, then you must  either  (1)  cause  the
<a id='L469' name='L469'></a>Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive  yourself  of
<a id='L470' name='L470'></a>the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a
<a id='L471' name='L471'></a>manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to  extend  the  patent
<a id='L472' name='L472'></a>license to downstream recipients.  “Knowingly relying”  means  you  have  actual
<a id='L473' name='L473'></a>knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a
<a id='L474' name='L474'></a>country, or your recipient's use  of  the  covered  work  in  a  country,  would
<a id='L475' name='L475'></a>infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you  have  reason
<a id='L476' name='L476'></a>to believe are valid.
<a id='L477' name='L477'></a> 
<a id='L478' name='L478'></a>    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single  transaction or  arrangement,
<a id='L479' name='L479'></a>you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a
<a id='L480' name='L480'></a>patent license to some of the parties receiving  the  covered  work  authorizing
<a id='L481' name='L481'></a>them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific  copy of the  covered  work,
<a id='L482' name='L482'></a>then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of
<a id='L483' name='L483'></a>the covered work and works based on it.
<a id='L484' name='L484'></a> 
<a id='L485' name='L485'></a>    A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope
<a id='L486' name='L486'></a>of  its  coverage,  prohibits  the  exercise  of,  or  is  conditioned  on   the
<a id='L487' name='L487'></a>non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are  specifically  granted  under
<a id='L488' name='L488'></a>this License. You may not convey a covered  work  if  you  are  a  party  to  an
<a id='L489' name='L489'></a>arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software,
<a id='L490' name='L490'></a>under which you make payment to the third party based  on  the  extent  of  your
<a id='L491' name='L491'></a>activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants,  to  any
<a id='L492' name='L492'></a>of the parties who would receive the covered work  from  you,  a  discriminatory
<a id='L493' name='L493'></a>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you
<a id='L494' name='L494'></a>(or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection  with
<a id='L495' name='L495'></a>specific products or compilations that contain  the  covered  work,  unless  you
<a id='L496' name='L496'></a>entered into that arrangement, or that patent  license  was  granted,  prior  to
<a id='L497' name='L497'></a>28 March 2007.
<a id='L498' name='L498'></a> 
<a id='L499' name='L499'></a>    Nothing in this License shall be construed  as  excluding  or  limiting  any
<a id='L500' name='L500'></a>implied license  or  other  defenses  to  infringement  that  may  otherwise  be
<a id='L501' name='L501'></a>available to you under applicable patent law.
<a id='L502' name='L502'></a> 
<a id='L503' name='L503'></a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<a id='L504' name='L504'></a>------------------------------------
<a id='L505' name='L505'></a> 
<a id='L506' name='L506'></a>    If conditions are imposed on you  (whether  by  court  order,  agreement  or
<a id='L507' name='L507'></a>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they  do  not  excuse
<a id='L508' name='L508'></a>you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work  so
<a id='L509' name='L509'></a>as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and  any  other
<a id='L510' name='L510'></a>pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at  all.  For
<a id='L511' name='L511'></a>example, if you agree to terms that  obligate  you  to  collect  a  royalty  for
<a id='L512' name='L512'></a>further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the  only  way  you
<a id='L513' name='L513'></a>could satisfy both those terms and this License would  be  to  refrain  entirely
<a id='L514' name='L514'></a>from conveying the Program.
<a id='L515' name='L515'></a> 
<a id='L516' name='L516'></a>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
<a id='L517' name='L517'></a>---------------------------------------------------
<a id='L518' name='L518'></a> 
<a id='L519' name='L519'></a>    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission  to
<a id='L520' name='L520'></a>link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU
<a id='L521' name='L521'></a>Affero General Public License into a single combined work,  and  to  convey  the
<a id='L522' name='L522'></a>resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to  apply  to  the  part
<a id='L523' name='L523'></a>which is the covered work, but  the  special  requirements  of  the  GNU  Affero
<a id='L524' name='L524'></a>General Public License, section 13, concerning  interaction  through  a  network
<a id='L525' name='L525'></a>will apply to the combination as such.
<a id='L526' name='L526'></a> 
<a id='L527' name='L527'></a>14. Revised Versions of this License.
<a id='L528' name='L528'></a>-------------------------------------
<a id='L529' name='L529'></a> 
<a id='L530' name='L530'></a>    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of  the
<a id='L531' name='L531'></a>GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be  similar
<a id='L532' name='L532'></a>in spirit to the present version, but  may  differ  in  detail  to  address  new
<a id='L533' name='L533'></a>problems or concerns.
<a id='L534' name='L534'></a> 
<a id='L535' name='L535'></a>    Each version is given  a  distinguishing  version  number.  If  the  Program
<a id='L536' name='L536'></a>specifies that a certain numbered version of  the  GNU  General  Public  License
<a id='L537' name='L537'></a>“or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
<a id='L538' name='L538'></a>and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published
<a id='L539' name='L539'></a>by the Free Software Foundation. If the  Program  does  not  specify  a  version
<a id='L540' name='L540'></a>number of the GNU General Public  License,  you  may  choose  any  version  ever
<a id='L541' name='L541'></a>published by the Free Software Foundation.
<a id='L542' name='L542'></a> 
<a id='L543' name='L543'></a>    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide  which  future  versions of
<a id='L544' name='L544'></a>the GNU General Public License can be used,  that  proxy's  public  statement of
<a id='L545' name='L545'></a>acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to  choose  that version  for
<a id='L546' name='L546'></a>the Program.
<a id='L547' name='L547'></a> 
<a id='L548' name='L548'></a>    Later license versions may give you  additional  or  different  permissions.
<a id='L549' name='L549'></a>However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder
<a id='L550' name='L550'></a>as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
<a id='L551' name='L551'></a> 
<a id='L552' name='L552'></a>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
<a id='L553' name='L553'></a>---------------------------
<a id='L554' name='L554'></a> 
<a id='L555' name='L555'></a>    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY  APPLICABLE
<a id='L556' name='L556'></a>LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR  OTHER
<a id='L557' name='L557'></a>PARTIES PROVIDE THE  PROGRAM  “AS IS”  WITHOUT  WARRANTY  OF  ANY  KIND,  EITHER
<a id='L558' name='L558'></a>EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE  IMPLIED  WARRANTIES OF
<a id='L559' name='L559'></a>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO  THE
<a id='L560' name='L560'></a>QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS  WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE  PROGRAM  PROVE
<a id='L561' name='L561'></a>DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<a id='L562' name='L562'></a> 
<a id='L563' name='L563'></a>16. Limitation of Liability.
<a id='L564' name='L564'></a>----------------------------
<a id='L565' name='L565'></a> 
<a id='L566' name='L566'></a>    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN  WRITING  WILL
<a id='L567' name='L567'></a>ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM
<a id='L568' name='L568'></a>AS PERMITTED ABOVE,  BE  LIABLE  TO  YOU FOR  DAMAGES,  INCLUDING  ANY  GENERAL,
<a id='L569' name='L569'></a>SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
<a id='L570' name='L570'></a>TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS  OF  DATA  OR  DATA  BEING
<a id='L571' name='L571'></a>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE  OF
<a id='L572' name='L572'></a>THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH  HOLDER  OR  OTHER
<a id='L573' name='L573'></a>PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<a id='L574' name='L574'></a> 
<a id='L575' name='L575'></a>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
<a id='L576' name='L576'></a>-----------------------------------------
<a id='L577' name='L577'></a> 
<a id='L578' name='L578'></a>    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation  of  liability  provided  above
<a id='L579' name='L579'></a>cannot be given local legal effect according to their  terms,  reviewing  courts
<a id='L580' name='L580'></a>shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver  of  all
<a id='L581' name='L581'></a>civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or  assumption
<a id='L582' name='L582'></a>of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
<a id='L583' name='L583'></a> 
<a id='L584' name='L584'></a>                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<a id='L585' name='L585'></a> 
<a id='L586' name='L586'></a> 
<a id='L587' name='L587'></a>               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<a id='L588' name='L588'></a> 
<a id='L589' name='L589'></a>    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
<a id='L590' name='L590'></a>use to the public, the best way to achieve this is  to  make  it  free  software
<a id='L591' name='L591'></a>which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<a id='L592' name='L592'></a> 
<a id='L593' name='L593'></a>    To do so, attach the following notices to  the  program.  It  is  safest  to
<a id='L594' name='L594'></a>attach them to the start of each source  file  to  most  effectively  state  the
<a id='L595' name='L595'></a>exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the  “copyright”  line
<a id='L596' name='L596'></a>and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<a id='L597' name='L597'></a> 
<a id='L598' name='L598'></a>  &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
<a id='L599' name='L599'></a>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
<a id='L600' name='L600'></a> 
<a id='L601' name='L601'></a>  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
<a id='L602' name='L602'></a>  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<a id='L603' name='L603'></a>  the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
<a id='L604' name='L604'></a>  (at your option) any later version.
<a id='L605' name='L605'></a> 
<a id='L606' name='L606'></a>  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<a id='L607' name='L607'></a>  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<a id='L608' name='L608'></a>  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
<a id='L609' name='L609'></a>  GNU General Public License for more details.
<a id='L610' name='L610'></a> 
<a id='L611' name='L611'></a>  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<a id='L612' name='L612'></a>  along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

<a id='L615' name='L615'></a>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<a id='L616' name='L616'></a> 
<a id='L617' name='L617'></a> 
<a id='L618' name='L618'></a>    If the program does terminal interaction, make  it  output  a  short  notice
<a id='L619' name='L619'></a>like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
<a id='L620' name='L620'></a> 
<a id='L621' name='L621'></a>  &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
<a id='L622' name='L622'></a>  This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
<a id='L623' name='L623'></a>  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
<a id='L624' name='L624'></a>  under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<a id='L625' name='L625'></a> 
<a id='L626' name='L626'></a> 
<a id='L627' name='L627'></a>    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the  appropriate
<a id='L628' name='L628'></a>parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be
<a id='L629' name='L629'></a>different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.
<a id='L630' name='L630'></a> 
<a id='L631' name='L631'></a>    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)  or  school,
<a id='L632' name='L632'></a>if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more
<a id='L633' name='L633'></a>information  on  this,  and  how  to  apply  and  follow  the   GNU   GPL,   see
<a id='L634' name='L634'></a>&lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
<a id='L635' name='L635'></a> 
<a id='L636' name='L636'></a>    The GNU General Public License does not permit  incorporating  your  program
<a id='L637' name='L637'></a>into proprietary programs. If your program is  a  subroutine  library,  you  may
<a id='L638' name='L638'></a>consider it more useful to permit  linking  proprietary  applications  with  the
<a id='L639' name='L639'></a>library. If this is what you want to do,  use  the  GNU  Lesser  General  Public
<a id='L640' name='L640'></a>License  instead of this License. But first, please read
